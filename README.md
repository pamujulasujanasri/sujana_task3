We used MYsql to execute SQL commands. We used select, where, order by and group by. "Order by" on any column gives the ascending order (by default) of the values, where as "Group by" should be used after using the aggregate functions, which are sum(), max(), min(), avg(), count(), it returns the a single value.
Join is used to join 2 tables- it has left join, right join and full join as it types. Left join gives the values of the left table and common values of left and right tables as it output.
Right join gives the values of the right table and common values of left and right tables as it output. Full join combines everything.
Views are virtual tables. indexing is done to find any value quickly.
